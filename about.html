<!--
Curious,
Enthusiastic,
Energetic,
Passionate,
I love science fiction and since I was young I have had a broadened imagination, I always have the idea of innovating new techs that help people and make life easier, so Ai is my real Passion.

 I like problem-solving, just to improve my coding skills and improve my thinking to be at full power and do that from time to time. I do university projects but I prefer AI, Machine learning, and Deep learning projects and getting in-depth.
I like to improve my skills to cope with the future and to be able to surpass my college peers.

I believe that GPA is necessary, the certificate as well, it is evidence for proficiency but sometimes some problems that are beyond you, happen and may cause trouble with GPA .but finally it depends on what you can do, what you really learned and able to show it.

My favorite wisdom is  "you get what you work for not what you wish for" and "hard work puts you where good luck can find you".

If you need any guidance or have some questions, feel free to contact me.
